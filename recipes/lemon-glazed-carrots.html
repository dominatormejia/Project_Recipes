    <p> This recipe is a no brainer for family dinner sides. Not only is it quick and easy, but incredibly teasty as well.   </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 carrots, sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place carrots into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until carrots are tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, brown sugar, and lemon juice in the melted butter, stirring often, until sugar has dissolved, 2 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
